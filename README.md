# Sudoku solver in Haskell

To practice Haskell I decided to port a small Sudoku solver I wrote in Python.
The solver is a basic brute force backtracking solver.

The solver is written in literate Haskell, which is cool for documenting a software.
The document is written in Literate Haskell and converted to Markdown with Pandoc.

So here is my own version...

- the source code in Literate Haskell: [sudoku.lhs](sudoku.lhs)
- the document rendered in Markdown: [sudoku.md](sudoku.md)
